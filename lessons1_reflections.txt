Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

could break something?

    Extremely comfortable knowing that I can roll back to a previous version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'm not sure yet...my next step is to learn javascript...finally yes...
